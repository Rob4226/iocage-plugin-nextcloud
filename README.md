# iocage-plugin-nextcloud
Artifact file(s) for NextCloud iocage plugin

### *Update
This 12.1-RELEASE branch is to update the Nextcloud iocage plugin to the latest 
release of FreeBSD and to use the latest versions of NextCloud, PHP, MaraiDB and 
Nginx packages available from the FreeBSD repository.

##### *Plugin includes:*
* FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE
* nextcloud-php73
* mariadb104-server
* nginx

Note: I am using this with a regular install of FreeBSD, not FreeNAS, but I would
imagine it will still work because I am leaving all the files from the 11.3-RELEASE
version of this plugin.
